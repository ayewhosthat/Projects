## Overview
In this assignment the goal was to create an interaction network by first collecting the number of interactions between characters of My Little Pony and storing the information in a json file, then creating a network to represent the interactions using the Python networkx package. In the second part of the assignment, we use the network information to compute the three characters with the highest measure of centrality using four different measures of centrality: 
- Degree centrality
- Weighted degree centrality
- Closeness
- Betweenness
