Was inspired to create this project in the middle of my course registration. This program would help me be able to:
- see course averages over the years where the crowdsourced data was available to decide if I want to take this course
- look up course descriptions and requirements without having to change websites all the time

Overall, I liked this project, where I got to learn and practice webscraping with BeautifulSoup and data cleaning/processing with Pandas

* data was collected from a crowdsourced Excel sheet
* this project was purely for personal use only, in no way was it intended for any purpose other than making my course registration process a little easier, while also practicing my Python skills
