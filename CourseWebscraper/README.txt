Was inspired to create this mini-project in the middle of my course registration. This program would help me be able to:
- see course averages over the years where the crowdsourced data was available to decide if I want to take this course
- look up course descriptions and requirements without having to change websites all the time

Overall, I liked this mini-project, where I got to learn and practice webscraping with BeautifulSoup and data cleaning/processing with Pandas

* data was collected from a crowdsourced Excel sheet
