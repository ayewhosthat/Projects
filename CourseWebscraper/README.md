## Overview
This project/program was conceived as a way to both facilitate information gathering when registering for my classes, and to get a feel for webscraping using BeautifulSoup. The program takes as input a course from the user, and displays historical crowdsourced course information, including averages for each term for that particular course. The main advantage to using this program as opposed to a regular web browser is that the program not only displays averages for each semester, but it also displays the overall average for all terms included in the historical crowdsourced data, to give the user a better idea of the class difficulty as a whole. 

### Notes
This project is intended for **personal** use only as a way to make my registration easier by saving time, and to also introduce me to webscraping.
