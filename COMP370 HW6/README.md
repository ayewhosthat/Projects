This assignment was centred around creating my own python package, called newscover. To do so, I first created my script newsapi.py, which collected news articles with the help of the NewsAPI API. Then, I implemented a few unit tests to make sure my newsapi.py module worked as intended. Specifically, I tested to make sure that my module produced an exception when the keywords argument was an empty list, when newsapi.py returned an article that was outside the date range, and when keywords contained a non-alphabetic character. For each of the three conditions above, I implemented two tests; one to test for the positive, and one to test for the negative. Finally, I wrote a command line tool to query articles given an input file containing lists of keywords and write them to an output file.
