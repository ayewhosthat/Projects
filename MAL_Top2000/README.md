## Overview
An exploratory data analysis of the top 2000 anime according to MyAnimeList (dataset found on Kaggle). This analysis had a focus on data cleaning, such as de-cluttering text columns and working with datetime objects to allow for easier analysis when answering important questions.
Examples of said questions that required the cleaning of data to be properly answered include:
- How has the number of anime released per year changed over time?
- Does the release month seem to have an effect on anime popularity and/or ranking? Why might this be the case?
- What is the most targeted demographic within the Top 2000 anime? Is there a particular reason as to why anime directed towards certain demographics performs better/is more popular than anime geared towards other demographics?
