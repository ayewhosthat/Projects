## Overview
In this assignment the 5 trending articles from the Montreal Gazette were collected, and information about the articles was extracted. This information included items such as articles author, date of publication, opening excerpt, and more.
I found this to be great practice in developing my webscraping skills - this assignment developed my sense of discovering what information would be contained where within a webpage's source code. It also helped me practice diagnosing issues when the information is not being extracted correctly. For example, initially, the information I wanted was not being extracted from the webpage, even though I had correctly identified the tags which held the information. It turned out the the issue was that I was using the incorrect URL in my script, which was the cause of the bug. Therefore, going forward, whenever I am performing a webscraping task, the first thing I will make sure to do is that I have the correct URL needed to properly perform the task.
