Here I explored a very basic anime review classifier, which put a review into either the Positive category or the Negative category. I use the 'Overall Rating' as the sole 
feature, as this is quite a basic classifier.

After loading in the data the dataset gets split into a training set and a test set. The models then get trained using the training set and then assigned an F1 score according to how well the model
predicts the results relative to the testing set.
