While exploring my enjoyment and passion for anime, I wanted to also improve my data analysis skills. I was able to use my knowledge of anime to make deductions and to answer questions about the data,
such as:

- Does the release month of an anime impact its popularity?
- What themes tend to bring in the highest scores?
- How has the number of anime produced change over time?
- Which age group is most often targeted within the Top 2000?
