## Overview
This assignment was split into two tasks:
- In task 1, the word counts of the 6 main ponies' dialog were collected. Some data cleaning was needed, as the episode dialog contained stopwords that would be uninformative and thus were not included in the ponies' word counts.
- In task 2, the top 10 words with the highest tfidf scores for each pony were computed.
